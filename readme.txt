What else do I need to create a marketplace?

BuddyForms WooCommerce Form Elements is build for one purpose, to make it easy for you to manage creating and editing your WooCommerce products. This plugin is a clean, bloat free solution to front end edition of your WooCommerce products.

<strong>Features</strong>:
The plugin generates two different views.

1. For the list of vendor products
2. For the creation and edition screen.

When used with BuddyPress, the members product listing can be displayed publicly to show their products directly within their profile page.

If you wish to integrate WooCommerce with BuddyPress please use our <a href="http://buddyforms.com" title="WooCommerce BuddyPress Integration WordPress Plugin" target="_blank">WooCommerce and BuddyPress Profile synchronization plugin</a>. This plugin makes it very easy to integrate WooCommerce and other WooCommerce plugins directly within the BuddyPress profile pages.

If you need a vendor management you can use any. This is a lot of freedom for you. You can change your vendors extension if you are unhappy, but all the rest will work. We decided to leave the vendor payment management to other plugins.

There are already vendor plugins available from WooThemes and other developers.
