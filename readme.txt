What else do I need to create a Socialised marketplace?

We believe that a plugin should work grate and should be build for one purpose Instead of try to make all possible in one solution but buggy or not easy to update.
Therefor with BuddyForms WooCommerce Form Fields you will manage all the creation and editing of your WooCommerce Products.

The plugin generates different views.

One for the vendor products and One for the create and edit screen. With the BuddyPress Plugin enabled the author product list can be public to show the users products in the profile.

If you want to Integrate WooCommerce with BuddyPress please see this Plugin. The Plugin makes it very easy to integrate WooCommerce or other WooCommerce plugins into the BuddyPress Profile. and manage WooCommerce and BuddyPress Profile synchronisation.

If you need a vendor management you can use any. This is a lot of freedom for you. You can change your vendors extension if you are unhappy, but all the rest will work. We decided to leave the vendor payment management to other plugins.

There are already Vendor plugins available from WooThemes and tther developers.
